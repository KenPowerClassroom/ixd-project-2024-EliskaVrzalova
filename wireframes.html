<h1>Wireframes</h1>
<h2>User task</h2>
<p>
    The user task I am designing is setting a goal where user is able to set a new goal they want to achieve
    (selecting and adding a new learning topic) and also is able to find and see their learning outcomes, progress and
    how close they are to achieve their goal.<br> Since these are two closely related tasks for the user, I have drawn two user flows to separate them.
</p>
