<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the introduction to my interaction design project, focused on gamyfying a learning app
    , My aim is to make the learning app more engaging and interactive for the users.
</p>
<p>
    Gamification incolves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as education.
    The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement, and enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
    This project involves various phrases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping,
    and usability testing. The competitive analysis will help me identify strenghts and weaknesses in the
    existing market, and highlight areas we can improve.
</p>
<p> 
    Wireframing and protyping allowes me to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app,
    ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, usability testing, is conducted to gather feedback from users on the app's usability and functionality.
    The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, the aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately
    improving the user's learning outcomes.
